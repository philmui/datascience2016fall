    "\n",
    "Glyphs are the basic visual marks that Bokeh can display. At the lowest level, there are glyph objects, such as Line. If you are using the low-level bokeh.models interface, it is your responsibility to create and coordinate all the various Bokeh objects, including glyph objects and their data sources. To make life easier, the bokeh.plotting interface exposes higher level glyph methods such as the Figure.line method used in the first example. The second example also adds in calls to Figure.circle to display circle and line glyphs together on the same plot. Besides lines and circles, Bokeh makes many additional glyphs and markers available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visual appearance of a glyph is tied directly to the data values that are associated with the glyph’s various attributes. In the example above we see that positional attributes like x and y can be set to vectors of data. But glyphs also have some combination of Line Properties, Fill Properties, and Text Properties to control their appearance. All of these attributes can be set with “vectorized” values as well. We will show examples of this below."

By default, plots generated with the bokeh.plotting interface come configured with DataRange1d objects that try to automatically set the plot bounds to encompass all the available data. But it is possible to supply explicit Range1d objects for fixed bounds. As a convenience these can also typically be spelled as 2-tuples or lists:\n",
